        <h3>Important Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Get feedback on email course or competitor from prospect, remind them of value that we provided</em></li>
          <li><em>Set up appointment for a free Adwords audit to get custom suggestions on how to improve their Adwords campaign (reduce losses, take opportunities)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <hr/>

        <p><strong>You:</strong> Sure, we would be happy to email that to you. In the meantime, why donâ€™t we review your current Adwords campaign, and and send you a custom report on how to improve it? We often discover thousands of dollars in wasted clicks or lost opportunities. Normally we charge $300 for an audit, but if you schedule it now we will waive that fee. Would you like to schedule that now?</p>
