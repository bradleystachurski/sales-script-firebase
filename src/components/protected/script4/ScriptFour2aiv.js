        <p><strong>You:</strong> That’s great. It’s unusual to find a business owner who is knowledgeable and has the time to invest. You know 53% of companies don’t properly use conversion tracking...and of those who don’t track conversions, 97 out of 100 lose money and have to end their campaign. Are you using conversion tracking?</p>
