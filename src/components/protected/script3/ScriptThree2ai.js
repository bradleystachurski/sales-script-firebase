        <p><strong>You:</strong> You clearly understand that advertising works, because you’re trying through (Groupon/Valpak). What if you knew what went wrong in your old Adwords campaign, and where you had opportunities to get more clients and better results? I’m sure you’d be interested to see that, right? We can do a free audit of your past Adwords campaign and share this knowledge with you. What do you say?</p>
